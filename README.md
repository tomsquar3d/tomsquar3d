🚀 About Me

I’m a UC San Diego Cognitive Science student specializing in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, with a strong focus on:

🧠 Neuroscience & cognition

📈 Data science & predictive modeling

🤖 Machine learning pipelines

🧬 Healthcare & EHR analytics

🎮 Game data, simulations, and optimization

I enjoy building real, end-to-end systems — from data extraction and feature engineering to modeling, validation, and visualization.

🧪 Current Work

🔬 Electronic Health Record (EHR) Research
Working with large-scale patient datasets to model:

Substance-use disorders (OUD, SUD)

Risk prediction via logistic regression

Clustering & survival analysis

📊 Machine Learning Projects

Protein sequence modeling

Kaggle competitions

PyTorch-based deep learning pipelines

🧩 **Multi-Agent Story Generation System**
I built a multi-agent AI system where specialized agents (plot, character, pacing, tone, continuity) collaborate to generate coherent long-form stories.  
Key features:
- Agent-based planning & memory
- Narrative consistency tracking
- Iterative self-critique and revision
- Long-context story generation
